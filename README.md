# viff-scrape

Python script to collect information on the current films listed on the Vancouver International Film Festival's website (www.viff.org) and save them as an excel spreadhseet.

* [viff_scrape.py](viff_scrape.py)

Gathers the following information on each film:
1. Title	
2. Running Time	
3. Year	
4. Director	
5. Country of Origin	
6. Language	
7. Description

Unfortunately, it does not acquire the screening dates/times.  This turned out to be a java script widget, so that would have to be done differently (e.g. with Selenium).

Typical operation:

```
$ python viff_scrape.py

 -------------- viff_scrape.py --------------
